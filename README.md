# Toronto-Crime-Data-Analysis
This project leverages real-world Toronto Police Service data (2014–2024) to transform raw public safety records into actionable business intelligence. Utilizing Excel for robust data cleaning and Tableau for advanced visualization, I engineered a multi-layered analytical suite consisting of interactive dashboards, geospatial maps, and temporal heat maps. By auditing reporting latency and seasonal surges, this analysis identifies critical operational gaps and high-risk periods, providing a data-driven foundation for resource optimization and community safety strategies. The impact of this project lies in its ability to uncover hidden patterns within large-scale datasets—such as identifying specific residential theft surges at midnight and mapping historical reporting lags dating back decades. By turning complicated location and time data into clear dashboards and storyboards, this work demonstrates a high capacity to translate technical data into strategic insights that support evidence-based decision-making in a high-stakes public environment.
