# Toronto-Crime-Data-Analysis
The primary goal of this analysis is to transition public safety efforts from reactive reporting to proactive crime prevention. By synthesizing 10 years of Toronto Open Data, this project identifies:
"Red Zone" Patterns: High-density time clusters between midnight and 4 AM where residential thefts peak.
Geographic Hotspots: Specific neighborhood clusters in Downtown Yonge and The Annex that require targeted resource allocation.

Data Source: This project utilizes the Toronto Police Service Open Data (2014–2024), consisting of over 100,000 incident records of Motor Vehicle Thefts.
